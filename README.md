# tested

In the early days of RMS, we needed a way of emphasising these different aspects of data-related thinking and how it flows through the entire project life-cycle. We organised our thinking into the following stages, mapped to the stages of a research project. 

* Design / Planning
	* Data ownership
	* Planning
	* Planning data collection and data entry
* Activity
	* Data collection
	* Data entry and organisation
	* Statistical analysis
* Reporting / Post-project
	* Interpretation and write-up
	* Data storage and access
	* Dissemination and feedback to data originators
