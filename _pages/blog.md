Something should go here about the strangeness of the work that we do - but phrased in a good way. I mean, we're not really academic, but a lot of how we think is based on good academic principles of "rigour", "critical analysis", "peer review". We're not really 'business-y', but we try to be efficient, think about 'cost-benefit' ratios, and pinpoint the places in a system where we can be most effective. We're not inventing new technology or new statistical methods, but we often take 'newish' ideas and try to implement them in a practical way. We waft back and forth between open-ended exploration and fast, focused, rigorous production.

Basically - we're an unusual group, and this blog will hopefully capture some of the whats, so-whats, and maybe even the occasional "now what" that arise from the eclectic range of work we do.
